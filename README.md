<!--About Me-->
           <h2>About Kristina</h2>
           <p>After graduating college with a B.A. in history, I worked as an administrative assistant for an orthopedic practice. 
               From there, my interest in technology grew and I became their onsite technical support where I got my A+ certification.
               Unfortunately, there wasn't much growth and was hired on by Reliable IT to continue my career in tech.</p>

            <p>While working at Reliable IT, I came to realize that I had a passion for creating something new. I enjoyed building and
                configuring workstations, but it wasn't quite what I was looking to do. My friends, who are web developers, suggested I
                look into coding. I took a few free online courses and I feel in love with it!</p>
                
            <p>I enjoy the idea of creating, problem solving, and tinkering with code. After much reflection, I realized this was the 
                career path that I wanted to pursue and I'm currently enrolled as a Full Stack Engineer at Thinkful.</p>
