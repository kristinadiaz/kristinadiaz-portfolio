 <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>After graduating college with a B.A. in history, I worked as an administrative assistant 
     for an orthopedic practice. From there, my interest in technology grew and I became their 
     onsite technical support where I got my A+ certification. Unfortunately, there wasn't much 
     growth and was hired on by Reliable IT to continue my career in tech.</p>

     <p>While working at Reliable IT, I came to realize that I had a passion for creating something 
     new. I enjoyed building and configuring workstations, but it wasn't quite what I was looking 
     to do. My friends, who are web developers, suggested I look into coding. I took a few free 
     online courses and I fell in love with it!</p>
     
     <p>I enjoy the idea of creating, problem solving, and tinkering with code. After much reflection, 
     I realized this was the career path that I wanted to pursue and I'm currently enrolled as a 
     Full Stack Engineer at Thinkful.</p>
